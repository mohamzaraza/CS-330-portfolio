## Design Approach

**How I approach designing software:**  
I start by breaking down the scene into objects (bench, ball, environment) and identifying the behaviors and interactions each object requires. I use a **modular and hierarchical design**, so objects are self-contained but can interact in a scene.

**New design skills I gained:**  
- Mapping textures accurately on 3D surfaces  
- Using lighting and shading to enhance realism  
- Structuring a scene hierarchically for easier debugging and scalability  

**Design process followed:**  
1. Sketch the scene layout and object placement.  
2. Create basic object shapes.  
3. Apply textures and adjust lighting.  
4. Test iteratively, adjusting light sources, shadowing, and textures.  

**Future applications of my design approach:**  
The modular approach can be applied in games, simulations, or any interactive 3D application. Hierarchical modeling will make future animations or interactive features easier to implement.

## Development Approach

**How I approach developing programs:**  
I build incrementally—start simple, then layer on complexity (textures, lighting, shadows). I test frequently to ensure each step works as expected.

**New development strategies used:**  
- Iterative texture mapping and lighting adjustments  
- Debugging lighting/shading interactions for realistic visuals  
- Modular code organization with separate classes for objects and materials  

**Iteration in development:**  
Iteration was key; textures initially appeared stretched or too dark, so I adjusted UV coordinates, light intensity, and object placement multiple times until the scene looked natural.

**Evolution of my development approach:**  
Early milestones taught me to focus on **object modularity and separation of responsibilities**, which helped me integrate lighting and textures more effectively in the final project.

## Computational Graphics and Skills

**How CS helps me reach my goals:**  
Understanding graphics engines, rendering pipelines, and transformations allows me to build visually accurate simulations or interactive software—skills relevant for game development or visualization tools.

**Knowledge and skills gained from computational graphics and visualizations:**  
- Applying textures and materials to objects  
- Adjusting lighting for realistic appearance  
- Structuring scenes for clarity and scalability  
- Understanding how visual computation relates to real-world physics and perception  

**Applications in future education:**  
- Simulating 3D systems for study or research  
- Interactive visualizations for educational software  
- Improved understanding of graphics pipelines for computer science coursework  

**Applications in future professional pathway:**  
- Game development (realistic objects, lighting, and materials)  
- Simulation software (medical, engineering, or scientific visualizations)  
- AR/VR applications requiring immersive, accurate 3D scenes
